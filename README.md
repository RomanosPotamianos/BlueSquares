# BlueSquares
This is a repository created for the assignment in the course Programming 2.

The primary focus of our group project is the optimization of issues related to the field of operations research. At the initial stage, our work will offer a structured menu of fundamental operational problems, allowing users to select a specific problem of interest and to dynamically input the necessary data. Subsequently, our program will provide the required solution based on the developed operations research algorithms.

The core problems for which we will see solutions include the following:
1. Travelling Salesman Problem
2. Vehicle Routing Problem
3. Bin Packing Problem
4. Linear Sum Assignment
5. Graph Coloring Problem
6. Quadratic Assignment Problem
7. (Weighted) Set Covering
8. Knapsack Problem
9. Shortest Path Problem

We select the VRP problem, which is a subset of shortest path problem.

#November 2024 
We will develop simple solutions programatically, with mere input interface, so we will become familiar with Software engineering, Git software and Github platform
