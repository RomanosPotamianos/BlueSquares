This is a repository created for the assignment in the course Programming 2.

The primary focus of our group project is the optimization of issues related to the field of operations research. 

At the initial stage, the group explored and considered the 9 fundamental operational problems:
1. Travelling Salesman Problem
2. Vehicle Routing Problem
3. Bin Packing Problem
4. Linear Sum Assignment
5. Graph Coloring Problem
6. Quadratic Assignment Problem
7. (Weighted) Set Covering
8. Knapsack Problem
9. Shortest Path Problem

After brainstorming application ideas the group chose to work on the VRP problem, which is a subset of Shortest Path Problem. Our application tackles the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), specifically by optimizing routes for courier services. The aim is to dynamically generate efficient routes for delivery vehicles, minimizing travel time, and maximizing fleet utilization. Our program will allow users to dynamically input the necessary data and will subsequently provide the required solution based on the developed operations research algorithms.

# November 2024 
We will develop simple solutions programatically, with mere input interface, so we will become familiar with Software engineering, Git software and Github platform
